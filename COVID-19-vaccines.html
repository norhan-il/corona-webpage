                        </h2>
                        <p class="bodyoftext2">The vaccines for COVID-19 differ in the way they are made. All these vaccines protect against COVID-19, but they work differently. Some use a whole killed virus; some just parts of the virus; some use other harmless viruses as
                            transport, like a trojan horse, and some are pieces of genetic material that give instructions to make bits and pieces of the virus to trigger immunity. Vaccines also differ in how they are stored. Some need to be stored at
                            very, very cold temperatures. These kinds of temperatures cannot be organized everywhere, so that has consequences in terms of where we can use them and where we cannot..</p>

                        <p class="bodyoftext"> It has been truly extraordinary, and we are also benefiting from the experience that we have acquired with other diseases, including Ebola. This has made it possible to develop these vaccines and fully evaluate them in clinical
                            trials much faster than before. Why is that? Essentially for one reason. We were conducting these trials in the middle of a pandemic, with many people infected. This gave us a lot of opportunities to see if the vaccine works
                            or not and the opportunity to conduct that assessment faster. Another important reason is the investment made by governments and the private sector to develop and produce these vaccines..</p>

                        <h2 class="titleoftext">How exactly do vaccines work?</h2>
                        <p class="bodyoftext">A vaccine helps a person build up immunity against a germ to protect themselves against an infectious disease. It works by injecting something that looks very much like a germ that stimulates the immune system to produce an immune
                            response. This is what protects a person from a future infection if they ever come across the real infection. That is the way that it works for most diseases and the way that it works for COVID-19. When we are vaccinated, we
                            are not just protecting ourselves, but also those around us. Each person vaccinated is one person that the virus cannot use to spread within the population..</p>

                        <h2 class="titleoftext">What people are worried about though are the side-effects. Was there enough follow up on the vaccines?
                        </h2>
                        <p class="bodyoftext">Yes, absolutely. Side-effects from vaccines happen in the very first weeks after the vaccine. Not many months after. So for these trials, the follow-up included the weeks during which side-effects could have occurred. Long-term
                            follow-up for those people vaccinated is also critical, and local health authorities, in collaboration with WHO and other partners, are committed to documenting any potential side-effects and the duration of immunity against
                            the virus.
